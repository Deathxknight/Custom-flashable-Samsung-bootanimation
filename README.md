# Custom Boot Animation for Samsung Devices

This repository contains a Magisk module to replace the default Samsung boot animation with custom `.qmg` files.

## Files
- `bootsamsung.qmg`: Main boot animation.
- `bootsamsungloop.qmg`: Loop animation.
- `shutdown.qmg`: Shutdown animation.

## Installation
1. Download the `custom_bootanim.zip` file.
2. Install it via Magisk or KernelSU.
3. Reboot your device.

# Custom files 

You can add your own qmg files to the zip . just make sure to chnage the permisions. 
This wont overwrite your system files !

If anyone has custom qmg files , ill make more modules with them and add them to this repo.
This is bearbones yes....in new to github
